To witness its simplicity, you may check it out [here](https://raccai.github.io/Simple-Dict-R/), [here](https://raccai.github.io/Simple-Dict-R/), and [here](https://raccai.github.io/Simple-Dict-R/). <br />
Simple-Dict-R is a simple dictionary that allows you to search for a word and details about it, specifically the following:
- phonetic
- part of speech
- definition
- example

You can navigate around using your mouse or your keyboard, so don't worry if you're missing a left click! And to add, this project uses the Free Dictionary API right here: https://dictionaryapi.dev/ <br /> If you wanna make your own dictionary application, this one'll be of great use to you.
